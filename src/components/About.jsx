      <p className='text-base leading-6'>With a dynamic background in Mechanical Engineering and a newfound passion for Front End Development, I bring a unique blend of analytical problem-solving and creative design to the world of web development. 
        My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Universidad Aut√≥noma de Occidente, where I honed my skills in precision engineering and systematic problem-solving. 
        This foundation has proven invaluable as I transitioned into the realm of Front End Development.My fascination with coding and web technologies led me to embark on a new path, and I quickly immersed myself in the world of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. 
        I'm continually expanding my skill set to embrace the latest industry trends and best practices. As a Front End Developer, I thrive on crafting user-friendly, visually appealing websites and applications that not only function seamlessly but also deliver exceptional user experiences. 
        My expertise in design principles and attention to detail ensure that every project I undertake is polished and professional.</p>
